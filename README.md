Data Import and Initial Cleanup:
•	imported your dataset from CSV files using Pandas.
•	dropped the 'Unnamed: 0' column from both the training and test datasets.
Data Exploration and Cleaning:
•	Performed initial data exploration by checking the shape of the datasets and looking for duplicate records.
•	Duplicate records were removed from the training dataset.
•	Checked for missing values in the dataset and calculated the percentage of missing values for each variable.
•	A subset of the dataset was identified where 'NumberOfDependents' had missing values.
Handling Missing Values:
•	For the subset of the dataset with missing values in 'NumberOfDependents':
•	Missing values in 'NumberOfDependents' and 'MonthlyIncome' were filled with zeros.
•	Confirmed that there were no more missing values in the subset.
Outlier Detection and Treatment:
•	Analyzed various features for outliers:
a.	'RevolvingUtilizationOfUnsecuredLines'
b.	'DebtRatio'
c.	'NumberOfTimes90DaysLate'
d.	'age'
e.	'NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse'
f.	'NumberOfTime60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse'
•	Some outliers were identified and, in some cases, winsorizing (capping) was applied to handle extreme values.
•	Notably, rows with 'DebtRatio' values that matched 'SeriousDlqin2yrs' were removed.
Data Imbalance Analysis:
•	Assessed the class distribution in the dataset and observed a significant class imbalance, with the majority of records being non-default cases.
Machine Learning Model Training:
•	Prepared the data for machine learning by separating the dependent variable ('SeriousDlqin2yrs') and independent variables.
•	An XGBoost classifier was trained on the data.
•	The model's accuracy on the training data was evaluated, achieving approximately 95%.
Model Evaluation:
•	Assessed the model's performance using a confusion matrix, heatmap, and a classification report.
•	Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy were reported for both classes ('No default' and 'Default').
•	The model showed good performance in identifying 'No default' cases but struggled with 'Default' cases due to class imbalance.
Summary and Further Steps:
•	Summarized the key findings, including the model's strengths and limitations.
•	Addressing class imbalance and exploring additional model improvement strategies were suggested as next steps.
